Sparx Enterprise Architect Extension to generate IDL 4 (RTI Connext DDS) files from the model

This Extension allows a menu entry to Enterprise Architect allowing you to generate IDL from any UML Model. 

To use it you must have Enterprise Architect installed in your
system. It has been tested with Enterprise Architect version 10 and version 12.

To install the extension. You may download an installer with the
latest release from here:
(https://github.com/rticommunity/idl4-enterprise-architect/releases)

The IDL generated uses the syntax of the latest version of the [OMG IDL
specification: IDL 4.0](http://www.omg.org/members/cgi-bin/doc?mars/15-04-01.pdf). Note
that the syntax of annotations is not fully compliant with
IDL 4.0. Rather it uses the OMG DDS-XTYPES syntax that provides
backwards compatility with earlier verions of IDL compilers.

Please use the [RTI Community forums](http://community.rti.com) to
discuss the plugin and provide feedback.
